History of the Drake Dragon
============================
Drake is a common dragon type in popular culture. Owing to the complex history of Drake as both a word and a popular last name, some clarification is needed in regards to the Dragon Type of Drake.

===========
Etymology
===========
In Middle English, drake means ‘dragon,’ following the Old English drake, which means ‘dragon, sea monster, or huge serpent.’ Drake likely relates to the proto-Germanic drako as well as the Latin draco, both meaning ‘dragon.’ These tie back to the Ancient Greek word drakon, believed to come from drakein or derkomai, ‘I can see clearly.’

The words dragon and drake separated around the thirteenth century when drake became an archaic Old English word that means dragon. Around this same time, drake indicated a male duck. Perhaps for this reason, the drake is considered to be a small dragon.

=========================
Disambiguation of Drakes
=========================
Traditional myth presents with two creatures named Drake. In the Balkan states, the Gypsy community’s Drake is a dragon with a humanoid body and no wings and rides upon a dragon. In Europe, specifically Sweden, drake is synonymous with Lindorm, an enormous serpent.

In the late twentieth century, the word drake became used as an indicator of a type of dragon, especially in European legend and heraldry. Drake is therefore a distinct dragon type.
